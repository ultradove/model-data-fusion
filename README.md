# model-data-fusion
The DALEC model and the model-data fusion code was used to generate the assimilated data for "Reference carbon cycle dataset for typical Chinese forests via colocated observations and data assimilation".

The code requires Matlab version 2014a or higher.

The DALEC model written in fortan is fistly published in the REFLEX project host by prof Williams Mathew (Mat.Williams@ed.ac.uk).

The main programm for MCMC and likelihood function is revised based on the code from John Zobitz (zobitz@augsburg.edu).
